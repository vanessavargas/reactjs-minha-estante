# Project My Bookshelf

This is a project developed in ReactJS based on the Alura courses "React: Developing with JavaScript" and "React: How Components Work." Customizations were made to the layout, adjustments to responsiveness, and the addition of modals for forms. There was also effort put into organizing the project architecture, including the structuring of folders and files.
